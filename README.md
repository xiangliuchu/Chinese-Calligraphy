今日有感而发，遂创此库。人心为物欲所弊，失其灵明，念己忘昔日所热爱之物，且不能持之以恒，顿感痛心，遂创此库，以唤昨日之热忱！

In today's society, there are too many temptations to calm down, all of them are pursuing short-term happiness, but they spend a lot of time on it, and they are deeply involved in it, forgetting their pursuits and plans, and people become very mechanical, and there is no continuous, long time for the brain to think. I used to be able to read and write quietly to improve myself, but now I can't do it, so I created this library to allow myself to calm down and improve myself as before.
